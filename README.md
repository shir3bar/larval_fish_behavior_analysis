# Larval fish behavior analysis 

A deep learning action recognition pipeline for larval fish behavior analysis.
This repository has 3 main parts:
* **Action classifier training** - train SlowFast video action classifiers using the pytorchvideo and slowfast libraries
* **Analysis pipeline** - using a fish object detector and action classifier to analyze raw videos
* **Bootstrap rates** - validate rates measured with the pipeline by bootstrapping
* **Archive** - code from previous iterations of these experiments

More documentation to come, for now you can find more details and 
the data [here](https://shir3bar.github.io/larval-fish-page).
