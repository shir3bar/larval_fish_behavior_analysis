# Larval fish behavior analysis 

A deep learning action recognition pipeline for larval fish behavior analysis.
This repository has 3 main parts:
* Action classifer training - train a SlowFast video action classifier using the pytorchvideo and slowfast libraries
* Curated analysis pipeline - using a fish object detector and action classifier to analyze raw videos
* Performance analysis - code for evaluating classifier under different data imbalances using a simulation study, currently only in R
