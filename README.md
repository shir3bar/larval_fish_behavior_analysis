# Larval fish behavior analysis 

A deep learning action recognition pipeline for larval fish behavior analysis.
This repository has 3 main parts:
* **Action classifer training** - train a SlowFast video action classifier using the pytorchvideo and slowfast libraries
* **Curated analysis pipeline** - using a fish object detector and action classifier to analyze raw videos
* **Performance analysis** - code for evaluating classifier under different data imbalances using a simulation study, currently only in R

More documentation to come, for now you can more details [here](https://shir3bar.github.io/larval-fish-page).
